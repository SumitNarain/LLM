# ðŸ©º Conversational Medical Assistant Agent

This project implements a structured, conversational AI agent designed to perform comprehensive patient history-taking. The agent guides the user through a sequential interview process (PC, HPI, PMH, etc.), synthesizes the information in real-time, and concludes by generating a final, structured JSON management plan, including the differential diagnosis and initial therapeutic recommendations.

The agent leverages the capabilities of modern LLMs (specifically `gpt-4o-mini`) combined with Pydantic schemas for reliable, structured output at every step.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Structured Interview Flow:** Follows a fixed, clinical sequence: Presenting Complaint (PC) â†’ History of Presenting Complaint (HPI) â†’ Past Medical History (PMH) â†’ Medications (MEDS) â†’ Social History (SH) â†’ Family History (FH) â†’ DONE.
* **Real-time History Synthesis:** Maintains a running, synthesized patient narrative in the `physician_note` field.
* **Clean Conversation:** Separates the running history from the next question, providing a clear, single question to the user at each turn.
* **Structured Final Output:** Upon completion of the history, the agent generates a comprehensive `ManagementPlanOutput` JSON object, including a primary working diagnosis, diagnostic plan, and therapeutic plan.
* **Modular Design:** Code is structured across multiple files (`main.py`, `medical_agent.py`, `models/`) for improved maintainability.
